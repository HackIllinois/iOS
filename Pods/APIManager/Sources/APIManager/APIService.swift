/// `APIService` defines all the properties and methods a class must contain to be used as a service in an `APIRequest`.
///
/// A class that conforms to APIService should also define all the endpoints relevent to that service.
///
/// An endpoint might look like:
/// ```
/// open class func getUser(byId id: String) -> APIRequest<ReturnType> {
///     return APIRequest<ReturnType>(endpoint: "/users", params: nil, body: ["id": id], method: .GET)
/// }
/// ```

    ///
    /// Endpoints in this service will be postpended to this URL segment. As a result a baseURL will generally look like the root URL of the API the service communicates with.
    ///
    /// A baseURL might look like: ```https://api.example.com``` with endpoints like: ```/users``` or ```/schedule```
    ///
    /// When interacting with more complicated APIs, it may be necessary to create subclasses of your service in order to maintain clean and readable code. In these cases the super-service should still have a baseURL as defined above. However the sub-services should have baseURLs of the form:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// override open class var baseURL: String {
    ///     return super.baseURL + "/users"
    /// }
    /// ```
